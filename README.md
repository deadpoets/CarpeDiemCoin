CarpeDiemCoin was originally a scam coin, launched with a very obvious (but not to everyone) 2 trillion diem in the genesis block. At the request of it's community, in particular, a Poloniex user by the name of tripppn, I helped orchestrate a hard fork onto a new diem blockchain without the scan genesis block, helped with a nearly complete diem v1 to v2 trade in, with the cooperation of all the exchanges Diem was listed on, and effectively reversed the original dev's scam. We did implement some code changes including migrating to PoS, but at the moment that code base is lost. Apparently all things that aren't well maintained come to an end.

Forces, however, are stiring.
