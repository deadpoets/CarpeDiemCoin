CarpeDiemCoin was originally a scam coin, launched with a very obvious (but not to everyone) 2 trillion diem in the genesis block. At the request of it's community, in particular, a Poloniex user by the name of tripppn, I helped orchestrate a hard fork onto a new diem blockchain without the scan genesis block, helped with a nearly complete diem v1 to v2 trade in, with the cooperation of all the exchanges Diem was listed on, and effectively reversed the original dev's scam. We did implement some code changes, and had a lot of plans, but life re-located me, and redirected my attention for quite some time, and apparently all things come to an end, that aren't well maintained.

Forces, however, are stiring.
